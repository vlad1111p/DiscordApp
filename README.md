# DiscordApp

(deprecated does not work anymore)

In order for this to work you need to add .env file in DiscordAPP folder.
The .env file needs to contain the following:

TOKEN= Your Bot token

CLIENT_ID= Your client id

PREFIX=/ 

WEBHOOK_URL= The webhook url of a channel  

To create a webhook url you need to go in your discord server and click on the cogwheel that is located on the right side of the channel nameplate. In the channel settings go to integrations and press new webhook. After that copy the webhook url and paste it in .env file.
This is a musicbot for Discord with additional features.
It can take a random joke or meme from reddit and post it on the channle where the command was invoked.
